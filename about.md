Hi there! you have found my experimentation playground. You can find my name in the front page of this website and I can tell you more about me, now that you are here ;)

If you ask me: **why are you walking this planet?** that would be a bit weird given that we just met, but ok I have thought about it. This is the best I have come up with:

>_”I am driven to create impact in society and to improve people's lives with high tech products that have business viability”._

Eventhough that sounds very bussiness oriented, it is something I strongly believe. I think of technology as a means to solve some of the most pressing issues in our society. Plus, I enjoy a lot coding and building new products.

However, that will not describe me fully as a person. This is one of the reasons you will find in this website different topics that I will write about. I do believe that a person is not defined only by his work, family, friends, or things owned. A person is a set of physical and psychological characteristics, stories, relationships, and whatnot, glued together in one body.

So, if you ask me again **why are you walking this planet?** my answer might change based on the time you do it. However, I can tell you few things that I love:

- I love spending time with my daugther and my wife.
- I enjoy a lot talking with my family and friends.
- I love beers :) really! I love them! I have a small collection of beer caps that I collected in the past years that I have lived in Europe. I am very proud of it.
- I love writting code and thinking of creative ways to solve a problem using technology.
- I love my home country too. In my free time I was working with a team of Mexicans committed to strengthen the link between academia and business in Mexico: [eNLaceMx](http://www.enlacemx.nl/). I have paused that for quite some time but I should get back to it sooner than later. I will write about it when I restart it.

You see, there are many things I love to do, and many I have left out otherwise the list would be endless. This is the reason I think is difficult to describe a person based on few criteria elements.

So that’s it! this is me! but before you leave, let me tell you a funny story about my name. I am from Mexico and I was given two names on birth: Omar and Esli. Omar is a very common name in arabic countries, but in Mexico became very famous at some point in history (I do not know the exact reason). However, my name was given to me from a Hollywood actor, his name is [Omar Sharif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Sharif). You might have seen some of his movies, one of the most famous is Lawerence of Arabia. The funny thing is that if you meet me, I will not strike you as having arabic heritage (not that is bad or anything). I look more like having Asian roots, somebody told me that I look like Hawaian, or Indonesian, Peruvian too. So, this story was a very good ice breaker when I moved to Europe. Some of the people I met there asked me: _so why are you called Omar?._ And I would tell them the story of the actor, and that’s it, I would start talking :)

Thanks for dropping by, now you can go, bye bye!!! or as my daugther says: hej hej!!! (with the cutest voice you can imagine)
