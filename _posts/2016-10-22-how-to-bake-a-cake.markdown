We can explain a product with three dimensions: why, how and what.

## Why

**Why** does the product exist? this is the most fundamental question of why the product exist. Take Facebook for example, it fills the void left in an era of consumism where short but continuous interactions with friends are more rewarding that deep relationships. It brings people together, in a sort of light but good enough way.

## How

**How** does the product achieve its goal? and **how** do we make the product fulfill the **why**? how Facebook came up to be and how it has keep up with its goal. How Facebook keep us coming back every day to the timeline.

## What

**What**, is the raw description of the product, in this example, Facebook is a software product.

# The how?

In this post I want to focus on the how, **how** do we build a product that achieves its **why**.

Product development is a human activity (until now) where a group of people create a product to be consumed.
This product can be a physical product, like the fidgeting cube (check it out here)[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/antsylabs/fidget-cube-a-vinyl-desk-toy], a software product like (Angry Birds)[https://www.angrybirds.com/], and anything in between that combines both software and hardware and delivers it to the user as a single item (iPhone, headphones, a car, an airplane, (that scaled quicly ).)
Since it is a human activity, it requires some sort of organisation to ensure that the product is built.
However, as I mention in the beginning, it is not only important that this product is built. It is also important that is consumed.

In simple terms, the consumption of a product helps to define a cost-benefit function that will relate the cost of a product to the revenue obtained from its consumption. If a product is massively consumed but it does not yield any revenue from its consumption, the cost to be produced it will be higher than the revenue from its consumption and it will eventually die. This is of course an over simplification.
Reality is much more complex, but this simple explanation will help us to set the basis for the rest of this post.

Ok. So if our goal is to ensure that a product is profitable, we can play with these variable:
- Cost to produce it.
- Revenue obtained when the product is consumed.
- Number of times we obtain revenue when the product is consumed.

Let's take two examples to explain all this.

### A amazing art piece: a painting

Let's assume a painting will be created by one person. It takes 100 dollars (in material) to be made plus 500 dollars of living expenses of the painter (we need the painter to be alive to create it :))
Since it is a cool piece of art, it is sold by 2000 dollars. The revenue of this product will be 1400 dollars.

Two important characteristics can be observed in this example. The painter requires creativity to ensure that the art piece is sold at that price. Second, the profits of the original version will be received once by the painter. The painter would have to create another one of those pieces to have such profits.

### A super cool mobile game: flying pigs (or rabbits or carrots)

This product most likely required more than one person to create it. This is just a random guess, but let's say that 4 software developers, two designers, one product manager, one marketing specialist, and one sales representative were hired for a period of one year to produce and sell the game. In total it was spent 500 thousand dollars, including marketing and administrative costs and anything that I cannot think of now. The game is given by free but within the game the users can buy chips by 1 dollars. If the game has 2 million users and half of it buys one chip that cost 1 dollars. The game would have produced 1 million dollars. In this case the revenue is roughly 500 thousand dollars.

In this example, the main characteristic of this game is that can be consumed a lot of times. In addition, the users within the game can consume the chips over and over again. However, the competition in the game industry is fierce and it requires a huge deal of innovation or tries to create such a successful game.

## The aftermath

Now, going back to the initial thought of this post: how to bake a cake. We are discussing how to create a product. In particular a successful product.

In both examples given above, the products required a lot of innovation to be sold and make them a success. And this is not easy to achieve. As (Donald Norman)[http://jnd.org/] says in his book (The design of everyday things)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things]: you either have a genious as leader or you have a method that can get you closer to achieve such a success.

If we think about: how to bake a product? we have multiple possibilities. Just in the software development industry we have: waterfall, scrum, agile, kanban, you name it. All these methodologies were created to increase the chance of success of a development team to create a product and they focus on different aspects of the product development process. I will not discuss all these methodologies in detail, I want to focus in the intersection of product development methodologies and software development methodologies. In particular the intersection between agile methodologies for software development and user centred design methodologies.

In the past years, the agile methodologies have gained a lot of adopters because of its short iteration cycles that match the User Centred Methodologies where short iteration cycles help to make incremental improvements to a product. In theory each iteration is composed by three steps: design, develop, and measure. With the last step being crucial, if you are able to measure the success of a improvement to a product, you should be able to make better decisions based on all the knowledge that you have gained on each iteration.
