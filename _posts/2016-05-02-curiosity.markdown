## How to drink from a cup of coffee?

I remember once I was driving with my brother for few hours by car and we stopped somewhere in the middle of a Mexican road to get a cup of coffee. We got out of the car, ordered the coffee, and went back into the car to keep going. My brother was in front of the drive wheel at that moment, so I was all set to enjoy my cup of coffee.

That’s when all begun,

>_how would I drink this coffee?_

The lid of the cup had a hole almost in the middle. There was no ordinary hole in the edge of the lid, as you might find in most of the coffee lids. There was only a little hole of around 2 mm diameter. My first thought was to drink the coffee from the hole, but it was too far from the edge of the lid. It was not comfortable to drink it from that weird hole. And that was the beginning of maybe one of the most annoying half an hour for my brother, I kept asking myself, **WHY? WHY ON EARTH there is a hole in there?** I started making all these hypothesis, maybe it was there to let the coffee breath, or maybe to let it cool off, but none of them made sense.

###_The "aha!" moment_
After some time, I realised that you were supposed to cut the lid, fold it, and then insert a small part of the lid into the hole. That was the best part! I finally understood why there was a hole. After that, I really wondered, who thought of this? in which cases would it make sense to have that hole? I am one out of maybe thousands of people who had used that lid, maybe it is just me who could not figure out the folding and cutting thing. But maybe not, some products are easier to use than others. Maybe is harder to design physical products, compared to designing and creating software products.

This is not the only time I wondered about how stuff works. When I was a kid I used to break stuff (that might be such a cliché for engineers, but anyway) and try to rebuild it into some kind of super cool secret weapon. I remember I did have a lot of fun destroying and trying to build things. When I grew up, I became an engineer with a mixed expertise in electronics and software.

This curiosity to know how stuff works helped me over the past years to get a good overview of how software products are developed. From an engineering point of view, from a technical management point of view, from the user perspective, and I have learned more and more how an engineering team interacts with other parts of an organization such as marketing, product design, and business development.

The mixed expertise I gained over the past years is what I am going to explore in the following series of articles. More specifically, I will dive into why I think it is important for a software engineer and the whole engineering team to know more about the context of the product being developed. For instance, how is the product used? who uses it? or who would use it (for startups with smaller user base)? What is the value that brings to a user? What is the value that brings to the organization?

>I describe this as _contextual programming_ or _empathic programming_ (I still need to come up with a better name)

This contextual knowledge, I believe, helps to trigger creativity and innovation that is so desired by both, the engineer and the organizations where they work.

If you have reached up to this point, I hope you did it because you found something that grabbed your attention. I would love to get some feedback from you, drop me an email here [omar.ejv@gmail.com](mailto:omar.ejv@gmail.com) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
